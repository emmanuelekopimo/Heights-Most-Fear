# Heights Most Fear

In "Heights Most Fear," players guide a hero left and right to land on platforms, striving to achieve a high score. Developed with Defold, the game features various elements to enhance the challenge and excitement:

- **Rocket Boosters**: These power-ups spawn randomly on platforms. When collected, they increase the player's speed and destroy any flying spikes in the hero's path.
- **Spiked Platforms**: Platforms with spikes that harm the hero and end the game if landed upon.
- **Flying Spikes**: Hazardous spikes that move through the air, which, if they touch the hero, result in game over.

The goal is to skillfully navigate the hero, avoid hazards, and utilize power-ups to climb higher and score points.
